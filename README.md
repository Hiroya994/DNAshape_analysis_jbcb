## About The Contents

Here, we aimed to construct the machine leaning models, which predict whether Transcription factor (TF) binding motifs in each gene promoter is in a DEG or non-DEG promoter region. We used Lasso regrresion to constrct the models, and evaluate the models by using The area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and The are under the curve (AUC). This github site include all script and data we used. Our script include the constrcing models by using Lasso, and evaluation the result by AUPRC and AUC, futhermore drawing the curve with 5 times Cross-validation.
